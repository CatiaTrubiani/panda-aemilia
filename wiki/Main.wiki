#summary This page presents "PANDA-AEmilia": Performance Antipatterns aNd feeDback on software Architectures, specified with the AEmilia Description Language.

= Introduction =

The problem of interpreting the results of performance analysis is quite critical in the software performance domain: mean values, variances, and probability distributions are hard to interpret for providing feedback to software architects. Support to the interpretation of such results that helps to fill the gap between numbers and architectural alternatives is still lacking.

PANDA is a framework for addressing the results interpretation and the feedback generation problems by means of performance antipatterns, that are recurring solutions to common mistakes (i.e. bad practices) in the software development. Such antipatterns can play a key role in the software performance domain, since they can be used in the search of performance problems as well as in the formulation of their solutions in terms of architectural alternatives.

This project aims at automating the detection of software performance antipatterns in the AEmilia Description Language.
