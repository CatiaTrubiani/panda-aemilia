The content of this project is here reported:

  * The specification of a metamodel ([see more details](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/wiki/AEmiliaMetamodel)), based on the _Performance Antipatterns Modeling Language (PAML)_, containing the architectural model elements of AEmilia, please refer to [Downloads/metamodel.zip](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/downloads/detail?name=metamodel.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges).

  * The specification of Text-to-Model Transformation Rules that allows the transformation of an AEmilia specification (file.aem) into an AEmilia model, please refer to [Downloads/text2ModelTransf.zip](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/downloads/detail?name=text2ModelTransf.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges).

  * The detection tool that allows the detection of software performance antipatterns in the AEmilia model by means of OCL rules, please refer to [Downloads/detectionTool.zip](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/downloads/detail?name=detectionTool.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges).

  * The user guide that explains how-to-use metamodel, text2ModelTransf, and detectionTool sources, please refer to [Downloads/PANDA-AEmilia-userGuide.pdf](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/downloads/detail?name=PANDA-AEmilia-userGuide.pdf&can=2&q=#makechanges).

  * PANDA-AEmilia at work on a case study ([see more details](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/wiki/BoAcaseStudy)): Bus On Air, i.e. a system aimed at developing a set of services for public transportation, please refer to [Downloads/BoA-caseStudy.zip](http://code.google.com/p/panda-aemilia/downloads/detail?name=BoA-caseStudy.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges).
